# Graph-Coloring

This code was used to schedule a list of matches where two teams of 5 players play. 
Constraints: - a player cannot play in two matches scheduled at the same time.
             - a player cannot play more than once per week.

Data sample:

J-549 J-628 J-379 J-073 J-980 vs J-548 J-034 J-127 J-625 J-667
J-152 J-681 J-922 J-079 J-103 vs J-409 J-552 J-253 J-286 J-711
J-934 J-367 J-549 J-169 J-569 vs J-407 J-429 J-445 J-935 J-578

Every line corresponds to a match, and J-XXX is the player's ID.

The problem was modeled and solved using Graph Coloring.
